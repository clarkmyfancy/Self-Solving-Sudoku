# Welcome! 

### Why does this project exist? 
 
The company I work for is called **Improving Enterprises**. And as its name might suggest, the all of us here at Improving are determined and motivated towards that end, continuous self improvement. As I was finishing up a side project I decided to present my solution to everyone in the office. My solution struck up some contraversy, which then led others to try to build a solution with a better runtime, or a solution that could solve more difficult puzzles (all of which are very important). Instead, however, I focused on the most likely (and most fun) use-case and decided to improve the user-interface. 

In short, I am building this because it's fun.
